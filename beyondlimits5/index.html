					<p>
						We are living in an era that is showing massive growth in data and computing power. We have seen
						a lot of progress in machine learning and deep learning, but there is an ever-growing need for
						more intelligent, more explainable AI.
					</p>

					<p>
						Most people’s perception of artificial intelligence boils down to either science fiction, or
						what we call conventional AI.
					</p>

					<p>
						The foundations of conventional AI are numerical techniques like data analytics, including
						statistical analysis, modeling, and machine learning. This has been the primary approach to AI
						over the past few decades with significant success by numerous companies in many industries.
					</p>

					<p>
						Data science has recently emerged as a hot topic in the industry over the last couple of years
						and has relied heavily on machine learning driven by more sophisticated algorithms and computing
						power. This approach has produced decent achievements, especially more recently, and has led to
						the development of deep learning. Companies like Google DeepMind are big players in this field,
						which has seen varying degrees of success in enterprise and industry.
					</p>

					<p>
						However, conventional AI still falls short of delivering value for complex, high-value
						industrial assets, especially in less-than-ideal conditions. Despite their ability to crunch
						numbers and find answers, most conventional AI or numeric approaches fail at delivering
						explainability and a clear understanding of how the answer was produced.
					</p>

					<p>
						Conventional AI isn’t transparent about why conclusions were made, how that information can be
						used to support critical decision-making, and how feedback loops can be instantiated so human
						experts can interact with the systems to make the process better over time.

					<p class="quote">Trust in the machine</p>
					<p>
						In high-risk, high-value industries such as energy, healthcare, and finance there is too much at
						stake to trust the decisions of a machine at face value, with no explainable understanding of
						its reasoning. Since machine learning is a component for many AI systems, it’s important for us
						to know precisely what the machine is learning.
					</p>

					<p>
						Machine learning is a great method for handling lots of data that can tell you the
						<em>what</em>. But for AI systems to become trusted advisors to human decision-makers they need
						to be able to explain the <em>why</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In order to make an AI system explainable, we add symbolic reasoning on top of numerical
						calculation. Symbolic reasoning allows the system to think like a person and supply human-like
						reasoning to its recommendations. This hybrid approach combining conventional, numeric
						techniques with symbolic reasoning is called cognitive AI. To comprehend this more intuitive
						approach, we have to turn to space exploration.

					<p class="quote">Symbolic AI: A key to the cognitive lock</p>

					<img src="images/6.KEY AND LOCK.gif" width="500" height="auto" class="img-left" />
					<p>
						Conventional AI relies on interpreting data to find patterns, but what happens in deep space
						where there’s no historical data to analyze? This is where symbolic AI becomes key.
					</p>

					<p>
						Symbolic AI has deep roots in the NASA unmanned space program. When the rest of the world was
						shifting to embrace the machine learning revolution, NASA kept investing in symbolic AI. Machine
						learning was not an option for NASA because there is little to no data in the unknown realms of
						deep space. The capability to handle changing conditions autonomously had to exist in order to
						support missions 150 million miles from Earth.
					</p>

					<p>
						NASA’s Opportunity Rover was on a first-of-its-kind mission to Mars, where conditions are harsh,
						unknown, and unpredictable. The rover would need to solve mission-threatening problems on a
						daily basis in order to not only effectively carry out its main objective, but also to ensure
						operational support for all the scientific experiments (and other tasks) it had to accomplish.
						Born of these essential needs emerged crucial technologies that are the foundational building
						blocks for today’s cognitive AI.

						<p class="quote">Autonomy is critical</p>
						<p>
							Autonomy was critical for the Mars Curiosity rover mission. The rover had to be self-reliant
							to navigate around its uncertain environment and be able to meet its objectives.
						</p>

						<p>
							NASA didn't have a lot of data when they first sent the rover to Mars; they didn't know what
							the weather or the terrain was going to look like. Nevertheless, it was imperative that the
							system be endowed with all the proficiencies necessary to cope with that uncertainty, come
							out on the other side unscathed, and with something to show for it all.
						</p>

						<p>
							Obviously, communication was extremely vital because while the rover was out exploring the
							mysteries of Mars, the engineers here on Earth could not rely on real-time communication. It
							takes seven minutes for a signal to travel 150 million miles and seven more minutes to
							return the call. We can hardly call this “real time.”
						</p>

						<p>
							In order to understand precisely what the rover was doing, and the decisions it was making
							autonomously, it had to be able to communicate and let the engineers in on exactly what it
							was doing and why it was deciding on the actions it was taking in response to new scenarios.
						</p>

						<p>
							For example, when the Mars rover first landed on its target planet, engineers knew that
							power management was going to be one of the most crucial issues for a successful mission.
							The system didn’t know how to solve every problem when it first arrived on Mars because it
							simply couldn’t be trained or educated about factors like weather or terrain in advance.
							Naturally, this knowledge was unavailable because the rover was traveling where nobody had
							gone before.
						</p>

						<p>
							One of the dynamic pieces of technology at the core of the rover’s system is used today in
							Beyond Limits’ AI systems: hypothetical scenario generation (HSG).
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p class="quote">Power management on Mars</p>
						<p>
							When bad weather hit Mars, the rover had trouble recharging its solar panels until HSG
							kicked into action and taught itself to correlate evidence that it was getting from the
							environment (in terms of weather and additional sensor measurements) to achieve human-like
							reasoning.
						</p>

						<p>
							Ultimately, the system itself taught the rover to turn its solar panels upside-down and
							shake off the accumulated dust blocking essential solar ray absorption. It executed
							human-like rationale to solve a problem in order to continue the mission. Through this
							feedback loop and autonomous learning, human-like cognitive thinking emerged.
						</p>

						<p>
							JPL scientists found that the rover had managed to teach itself how to correlate sensory
							evidence with its mission objectives and build the first practical weather model of a
							distant planet.
						</p>

						<p>
							As a result of intelligent power management, the mission was an incredible success, and
							actually extended far beyond the timeline scientists were initially projecting.

								<strong>Autonomy:</strong> Mars is 150 million miles from Earth. Neptune is 2.7 billion

						Cognitive AI is successful because it tackles each problem through combining an understanding of
						the problem in terms of underlying theories, human knowledge, objectives, and priorities that
						need to be addressed. All of these components, in conjunction with the power of numerical
						systems, can ingest a variety of data across many different sources, and ultimately leverage
						today's most sophisticated numerical algorithms to extract valuable features and concepts.
					</p>

					<p>
						The cognitive reasoning engine employs symbolic logic, human-like reasoning, intuition,
						cognitive planning, and common sense to hybridize a numeric and symbolic approach to deliver a

					<p class="quote">Support for mission-critical decisions</p>

					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							What are the risks and/or opportunities associated with these mission critical decisions?
						</li>
						<li>How can we quantify uncertainty, and communicate that back to the key players?</li>
						<li>
							How do we encode and leverage human expertise and experience to inform the cognitive
							reasoner?
						</li>
						<li>How do we make suggestions human experts can understand and rely on?</li>
						<li>
							How do we return to this system (as we acquire more knowledge and expertise) and ensure it

					</ul>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
					<p class="quote">Thinking for itself</p>
					<p>
						If you really think about it, our cognitive technology is based on concepts. You can describe a
						concept at a strict algorithmic level, or you can choose to add more natural language components
						that give the system the ability to explain itself.
					</p>

					<p>
						Beyond Limits’ cognitive systems have to say: “I have been educated to understand this kind of
						problem; you're presenting me with a set of features, so I need to manipulate those features
						relative to my education.” That process of manipulating the features in order to perform
						inductive, deductive, and abductive reasoning produces an explainable trail. If the natural
						language declarations are in place, then the system can (at a later time or in conjunction)
						produce natural language descriptions of what it's doing at any given moment.
					</p>

					<p>
						Explainability becomes a powerful tool when AI engineers work with subject matter experts to
						learn about their respective specialties. The engineers study the specialty from an
						algorithm/process/detective perspective, and then annotate it in a form to enable the machine to
						provide explainability at a human level of understanding. This was a requirement for space
						missions that Beyond Limits’ scientists solved years ago.
					</p>

					<p class="quote">AI at work</p>
					<img src="images/12.AI-AT-WORK.png" width="500" height="auto" class="img-right" />
					<p>
						Beyond Limits’ Cognitive AI for refinery management is a prime example of how an explainable AI
						system can support people in challenging, high-stakes environments, where there may be extreme
						consequences to imperfect decisions. This technology unifies numeric and symbolic AI to act as a
						trusted partner to the humans working with intricate equipment every day. The cognitive system
						and human can collaboratively make decisions so the refinery may run as efficiently as possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						The system accomplishes this by taking in data from all the refinery’s sensors to get a
						comprehensive picture of what exactly is happening in the facility, then using machine learning
						to analyze the data, identify trends and determine whether operations are headed in an
						undesirable direction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Add in the symbolic layer (which includes information regarding: the refinery’s goals, best
						practices for operation, historical subject matter knowledge), and all elements work together to
						provide users with explainable, transparent resolutions to anticipated problems alongside
						trusted recommendations.
					</p>

					<p>
						AI solutions such as this are designed for large-scale industrial facilities where complex
						processes need to be monitored and adjusted constantly to accommodate the flow of ongoing
						operations, shifting regulatory conditions, aging equipment with behavioral changes, oscillating
						market conditions, and numerous other factors.

						high-value products, Beyond Limits’ Cognitive AI for refinery management can generate millions

					<p>
						Other Beyond Limits technologies have similar upside potential. For example: Cognitive AI for
